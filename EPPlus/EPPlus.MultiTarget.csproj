      EPPlus 4.5.2.1

      New features in version 4.5:
      * .NET Core support
      * Sparklines
      * Sort method added to ExcelRange
      * Bug fixes and minor changes, see below and visit https://github.com/JanKallman/EPPlus for tutorials, samples and the latest information

      Important Notes:
      Breaking change in .NET Core: The Worksheets collection will be zero based as default.
      This can be altered by setting the ExcelPackage.Compatibility.IsWorksheets1Based to true.
      .NET Core will have this property set to false, and .Net 3.5 and .Net 4 version will have this property set to true for backward compatibility reasons.
      This property can also be set via the appsettings.json file in .Net Core or the app.config file. See sample project for examples!

      .NET Core uses a preview of System.Drawing.Common, so be aware of that. We will update it as Microsoft releases newer versions.
      System.Drawing.Common requires libgdiplus to be installed on non-Windows operating systems.
      Use your favorite package manager to install it.
      For example:

      Homebrew on MacOS:
      brew install mono-libgdiplus

      apt-get:
      apt-get install libgdiplus
