// This module defines the ZipInputStream class, which is a stream metaphor for
// reading zip files.  This class does not depend on Ionic.Zip.ZipFile, but rather
// stands alongside it as an alternative "container" for ZipEntry, when reading zips.
//
// It adds one interesting method to the normal "stream" interface: GetNextEntry.
