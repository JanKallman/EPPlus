// This module defines the ZipOutputStream class, which is a stream metaphor for
// generating zip files.  This class does not depend on Ionic.Zip.ZipFile, but rather
// stands alongside it as an alternative "container" for ZipEntry.  It replicates a
// subset of the properties, including these:
//
//  - Comment
//  - Encryption
//  - Password
//  - CodecBufferSize
//  - CompressionLevel
//  - CompressionMethod
//  - EnableZip64 (UseZip64WhenSaving)
//  - IgnoreCase (!CaseSensitiveRetrieval)
//
// It adds these novel methods:
//
//  - PutNextEntry

    ///   Both the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can be used
    ///   to create zip files. Both of them support many of the common zip features,
    ///   including Unicode, different compression levels, and ZIP64.   They provide

    ///   The <c>ZipFile</c> class is generally easier to use than
    ///   <c>ZipOutputStream</c> and should be considered a higher-level interface.  For
    ///   example, when creating a zip file via calls to the <c>PutNextEntry()</c> and
    ///   <c>Write()</c> methods on the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class, the caller is
    ///   responsible for opening the file, reading the bytes from the file, writing
    ///   those bytes into the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, setting the attributes on the
    ///   <c>ZipEntry</c>, and setting the created, last modified, and last accessed
    ///   timestamps on the zip entry. All of these things are done automatically by a
    ///   call to <see cref="ZipFile.AddFile(string,string)">ZipFile.AddFile()</see>.
    ///   For this reason, the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> is generally recommended for use

    ///   at the cost of increased memory use at runtime.  (The output of the
    ///   compression is almost exactly the same size).  But, the multi-threaded
    ///   approach incurs a performance hit on smaller files. There's no way for the
    ///   ZipOutputStream to know whether parallel compression will be beneficial,
