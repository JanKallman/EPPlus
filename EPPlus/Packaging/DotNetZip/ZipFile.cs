// This module is part of DotNetZip, a zipfile class library.
// The class library reads and writes zip files, according to the format
// described by PKware, at:
// http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/popups/appnote.txt
//
//
// There are other Zip class libraries available.
//
// - it is possible to read and write zip files within .NET via the J# runtime.
//   But some people don't like to install the extra DLL, which is no longer
//   supported by MS. And also, the J# libraries don't support advanced zip
//   features, like ZIP64, spanned archives, or AES encryption.
//
// - There are third-party GPL and LGPL libraries available. Some people don't
//   like the license, and some of them don't support all the ZIP features, like AES.
//
// - Finally, there are commercial tools (From ComponentOne, XCeed, etc).  But
//   some people don't want to incur the cost.
//
// This alternative implementation is **not** GPL licensed. It is free of cost, and
// does not require J#. It does require .NET 2.0.  It balances a good set of
// features, with ease of use and speed of performance.
//
// This code is released under the Microsoft Public License .
// See the License.txt for details.
//
//
// NB: This implementation originally relied on the
// System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream base class in the .NET Framework
// v2.0 base class library, but now includes a managed-code port of Zlib.
