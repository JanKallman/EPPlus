    ///   specification, but rather imply the use of a vendor-specific extension from
    ///   WinZip. If you want to produce interoperable Zip archives, do not use these
    ///   values.  For example, if you produce a zip archive using WinZipAes256, you
    ///   will be able to open it in Windows Explorer on Windows XP and Vista, but you
    ///   will not be able to extract entries; trying this will lead to an "unspecified
    ///   error". For this reason, some people have said that a zip archive that uses
    ///   WinZip's AES encryption is not actually a zip archive at all.  A zip archive
    ///   produced this way will be readable with the WinZip tool (Version 11 and
    ///   beyond).

    ///   that use DotNetZip to read zip archives will be able to read AES-encrypted
    ///   archives produced by those tools or libraries.  Consult the documentation for

    ///   In case you care: According to <see

    ///   algorithm that complies with <see
    ///   href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">RFC 2898</see>, using an iteration
    ///   count of 1000.  The algorithm is sometimes referred to as PBKDF2, which stands

    ///   A word about password strength and length: The AES encryption technology is
    ///   very good, but any system is only as secure as the weakest link.  If you want
    ///   to secure your data, be sure to use a password that is hard to guess.  To make
    ///   it harder to guess (increase its "entropy"), you should make it longer.  If
    ///   you use normal characters from an ASCII keyboard, a password of length 20 will
    ///   be strong enough that it will be impossible to guess.  For more information on
    ///   that, I'd encourage you to read <see
